There are two main files here: import1.py and unit_test1.py
import1.py contains a series of functions. It reads in a txt file and
splits the lines and returns patient characteristics. It also performs
TSH value testing on the patient data. Finally, it creates individual json
files to store each patient's data and diagnosis.

unit_test1.py performs pytest on TSH diagnosis function using 10 scnenarious
of TSH values.

The resulting 10 patients' json files are uploaded as well.
